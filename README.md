# Cloud Defense Security Project  

## ðŸ“– Introduction  
This project demonstrates the complete process of designing and validating a secure, compliant, and resilient cloud-based architecture.  
It begins with a **theoretical case study** focused on hybrid cloud adoption, regulatory compliance, risk management, and governance models.  
The findings are then translated into practice through **system benchmarking and load testing**, where the architecture is validated for stability, scalability, and performance.  

Together, these two parts show both the **conceptual strength** of the architecture and its **practical viability under real-world conditions**.

## ðŸ“‘ Project Structure  

- [**Hybrid Cloud, Compliance & Risk Management**](Hybrid-Cloud-Comp-Risk.md)  
  *Covers the theoretical foundation: service models, deployment strategy, regulatory frameworks, secure development lifecycle, and risk management practices.*  

- [**System Benchmarking & Load Testing**](System%20Benchmarking%20&%20Load%20Testing.md)  
  *Validates the theoretical design through practical experiments, including stress testing, performance metrics, and stability analysis.*
